        <h1>COVID? The biggest hoax in human history?</h1>
  </head>
      <body>
          <p>
              At this rate, everyone and their mother's dog knows about COVID-19 however
               not anyone is convinced that it was a real disease. So lets investigate,
              were people really affected by covid19 or is the biggest hoax in human
              history?

          <p> 
            There's nothing more tangible than death (that got morbid very fast..)
            It seems as though there generally was an increase in deaths from 2020-2022 corresponding
            with the covid years. But I hear you, people die all the time, especially if they're old.
          Okay, fine, lets see if we can find anything about the death rate across the ages during those covid years </p>

            <script src="stackedchart.js"></script>
            <p> Okay, so I guess that doesnt really tell us much. Sure, more older people died during the covid years
              than usual, big whoop, doesnt that happen every year? So you remain unconvinced, no worries.
               Let's try something else then, let's see how many people actually got COVID in 2020 across the countries. Surely they cant all be lying...</p>
